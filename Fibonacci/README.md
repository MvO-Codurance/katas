# Fibonacci

## Step 1

Fibonacci number (Fibonacci sequence), named after mathematician Fibonacci, is a sequence of numbers that looks like this:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...

You get first two starting numbers, 0 and 1, and the next number in the sequence is always the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci introduced it in 1202, in his book Liber Abaci.

So what will be your task? You should write a function `fib`, that takes one parameter `steps`, and returns a number from the Fibonacci sequence, based on the parameter `steps`, which determines the position in Fibonacci number.

For example `fib(0)` returns `0`, `fib(4)` returns `3`, `fib(15)` returns `610`.



## Step 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 0 and 1, the first 10 terms will be:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
